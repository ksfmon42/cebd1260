This application is invoked with 

	python app2.py

It needs to be Python 2

And there's a dependency of the pickle file "taggedDigitSoftwareReviews" which is not checked in to GitHub
due to size consideration.  It can be generated as part of running Notebook "Exploration 3" though.
For similar reason, the "static" directory and its contents have been excluded from GitHub as well.

Also, for now, this app does not render a separate "result.html" page but output 2 plots directly onto the existing page.
